The Road Network Analysis and Optimization project aim to develop a robust system for analyzing and optimizing road networks using graph algorithms and data analysis techniques. The project focuses on processing road network data (Road network of Pennsyvania, https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-PA.html) , performing graph analysis tasks such as BFS and DFS, selecting key nodes based on degree, and evaluating network performance metrics like average path lengths. 

Potential use cases: 
- Urban Planning: Analyzing road networks for urban development, traffic management, and infrastructure planning.
- Transportation Management: Optimizing routes, identifying congestion points, and improving public transportation systems.
- Logistics and Supply Chain: Analyzing supply chain routes, optimizing delivery networks, and reducing transportation costs.
- Emergency Response: Identifying critical nodes for emergency response planning and resource allocation during disasters or emergencies.

The Road Network Analysis and Optimization project will result in a software tool or system that enables users to analyze, optimize, and visualize road networks for various applications. The project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for improving network efficiency, reliability, and performance in real-world scenarios.
